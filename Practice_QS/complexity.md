Let's analyze the time complexity of the given Python code:

```python
n = int(input("Number"))

i = 2
while i <= n:
    print("hello")
    i = i**2
```

### Conceptual Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - `i` starts at 2.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Inside the Loop**:
   - Print "hello".
   - Update `i` to `i**2` (i.e., square the current value of `i`).

### Detailed Explanation

Let's break down what happens in each iteration:

1. **First Iteration**:
   - `i` starts at 2.
   - Print "hello".
   - Update `i` to `i**2`, so `i = 2**2 = 4`.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 4.
   - Print "hello".
   - Update `i` to `i**2`, so `i = 4**2 = 16`.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - `i` is now 16.
   - Print "hello".
   - Update `i` to `i**2`, so `i = 16**2 = 256`.

### Pattern and Complexity Analysis

- Each iteration squares the value of `i`.
- This means `i` grows extremely fast, much faster than a simple doubling.
- After the first iteration, `i` becomes 4.
- After the second iteration, `i` becomes 16.
- After the third iteration, `i` becomes 256, and so on.

To determine how many iterations are required for `i` to exceed `n`:
- Initially, `i = 2`.
- After \(k\) iterations, `i` will be \(2^{2^k}\).

We need to find \(k\) such that \(2^{2^k} > n\).

Taking the logarithm (base 2) of both sides twice:
- First, take the logarithm: \(2^k > \log_2(n)\).
- Then, take the logarithm again: \(k > \log_2(\log_2(n))\).

Thus, the number of iterations \(k\) is proportional to \(\log_2(\log_2(n))\).

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the loop is \(O(\log \log n)\) because the number of iterations required for `i` to exceed `n` is proportional to the double logarithm of `n`.

### Summary

- **Initialization**: \(O(1)\).
- **Loop Iterations**: \(O(\log \log n)\) due to the extremely fast exponential growth of `i`.
- **Total Time Complexity**: \(O(\log \log n)\).

The very rapid growth of `i` (squaring in each iteration) leads to a very efficient algorithm that requires only a logarithmic number of logarithmic steps relative to the input size \(n\).
